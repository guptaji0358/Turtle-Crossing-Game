# Turtle-Crossing-Game
Python X Turtle Crossing Game

# 🐢 Turtle Crossing Game (Python)

A fun and interactive **Turtle Crossing Game** built using **Python Turtle** as part of my learning journey in the **100 Days of Code** challenge.

In this game, the player helps a turtle cross a busy road while avoiding moving cars. The game becomes harder as levels increase.
